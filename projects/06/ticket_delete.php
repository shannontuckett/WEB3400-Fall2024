// Check if the $_GET['id'] exists; if it does, get the ticket record from the database and store it in the associative array $ticket. If a ticket with that ID does not exist, display the message "A ticket with that ID did not exist."

// Check if $_GET['confirm'] == 'yes'. This means they clicked the 'yes' button to confirm the removal of the record.
// If yes, prepare and execute an SQL DELETE statement to remove the ticket where id == the $_GET['id'].
// Also, delete all comments associated with that ticket.
// Else (meaning they clicked 'no'), return them to the tickets.php page.
