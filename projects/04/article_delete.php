// Step 1: Include config.php file

// Step 2: Secure and only allow 'admin' users to access this page

// Step 3: Check if the $_GET['id'] exists; if it does, get the article record from the database and store it in the associative array $article. If an article with that ID does not exist, display "An article with that ID did not exist."

// Step 4: Check if $_GET['confirm'] == 'yes'. This means they clicked the 'yes' button to confirm the removal of the record. Prepare and execute a SQL DELETE statement where the article id == the $_GET['id']. Else (meaning they clicked 'no'), return them to the articles.php page.
